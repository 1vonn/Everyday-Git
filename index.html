    <h1>What is Git</h1>
    <p>Git is a widely-used version control system that allows developers to manage and track changes to their codebase efficiently.
        Git is a version control system that tracks changes to code, enabling collaboration, history tracking, and seamless integration of modifications.
        Version control system (VCS), is a tool that tracks and manages changes to files over time.
        While there are several version control systems available, such as Mercurial and Subversion (SVN), this blog will primarily focus on Git and its integration with GitHub. Git is widely used for its distributed version control capabilities, enabling developers to work offline and collaborate seamlessly. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and facilitates collaboration among developers. Together, Git and GitHub provide a robust environment for version control and collaboration in software development projects.
